# README.md Generator

## Description:
This app generates a README.md file for the user based on a series of questions that they answer in the Terminal. It is run with node.js

 ## Challenges:
 * license badge and license link
 * function to properly display and format user README
 * still confused about how to manipulate an object, use it later in a function
 * ran into issue regarding indentation where the parts of the README weren't being displayed correctly because they were indented too far and needed to be flush with the left margin

 ## Languages built with:
 * JavaScript
 * ES6
 * JQuery
 * Node.js
 * inquirer
 * fs
